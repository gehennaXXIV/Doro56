W - 379.09mm - H 126.74mm


* 3mm Top Layer
* 3mm Upper Middle Layer (MCU Cutout)
* 5mm Middle Layer (usb + trrs cutout)
* 5mm Middle Layer (usb cutout)
* 5mm Middle Layer (no usb cutout)
* 3mm Base Layer


same case, but split into multiple parts for supposedly cheaper laser cutting, also requires more screws/standoffs. You can either use 2x Top Layer, or 1x Top and 1x Upper Middle Layer, depending on your MCU height, of course.
