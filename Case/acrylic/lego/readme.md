* 3mm Top Layer (x2)
	OPTIONAL:
	* 3mm Top Layer (with MCU cutout if you need height clearance)
* 10mm (2x5mm) Middle Layers 
	* This will include parts for both TRRS and non-TRRS builds

* 2mm Base layer
	* This will also include additional parts (base 2mm + 2x2mm) if you need bottom height (ie. for batteries)

same case, but split into multiple parts for supposedly cheaper laser cutting, also requires more screws/standoffs. You can either use 2x Top Layer, or 1x Top and 1x Upper Middle Layer, depending on your MCU height, of course.

20x 13mm or 15mm female to female standoffs
20x 5mm wafer head screws (bottom)
20x 8mm wafer head screws (top)

currently untested
