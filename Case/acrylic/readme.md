**Dimensions:**  
- Width: 379.09mm  
- Height: 126.74mm (both sides)

The bottom layer can be either 3mm or 5mm thick, depending on the bottom clearance you need. This clearance is mainly for batteries, so don't forget to add +2mm to both the case and plate brass standoffs as well.

**Top Layer (4a):**  
If your MCU is taller than the plate, use 1x of this and 1x of the 4 top layer instead. However, I recommend using millmax pins and trimming the excess so they stay flush with the top of the plate. (In my case, I used harvested RGB header pins since they are cheaper.)
